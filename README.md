# An Intelligent Platform for Durability Monitoring of Reinforced Concrete Structures

![Example of Platform](https://github.com/vagifaliyev/HWU-Project/blob/master/image.png)

With ever increasing amounts of concrete structures, the monitoring of the performance of the surface zone of concrete has become more essential as it is a major factor in governing the rate of deterioration and predicting the in-service performance of the structure. Prof W.J McCarter has developed a remote interrogation system in Dornoch (Scotland) to study the performance of the cover-zone concrete. Previously, the data from the system had to be retrieved, combined, corrected and graphed manually through Excel for monitoring and analysis. 

This piece of research focuses on developing a web application that can automate the processes performed manually previously and enhance the user experience for better monitoring and analysis of data. A database was created to automatically add the readings from the system developed. The user can specify the exact combination of sensors and declare variables for data correction. The corrected values are then displayed as scatter charts with features such as interactive legends, hoover tooltip and range slider that provide more clarity to data compared with static charts in Excel. For a more accurate analysis, the activation energies for the specimens are calculated and presented to the user. To provide more insight into the site conditions, a separate database containing temperature and tidal data from the nearest stations was developed.
